### Test ReactJS Project
Hosted on [heroku](https://naidzel-clothing-live.herokuapp.com/)
- Simple test clothing store
- Firebase DB
- Stripe payment

Note: Loading may take longer than expected if app is first spun up: this is due to the application being hosted on Heroku. However, the app can also use further optimisation for quicker loading times!

### Future Improvements
- Implement mobile responsiveness
- Implement loading of components in chunks via React Lazy and Suspense
- Write tests with Jest/Enzyme
